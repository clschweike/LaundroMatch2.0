# LaundroMatch2.0
Revamp of Intro to SWE team semester project - reservation system for hypothetical laundromat

Notes to self: 
- Created this GitHub project (**LaundroMatch2.0**), then folder in Fun-CS-Stuff folder (**LaundroMatchRevamp**), then opened that folder as an Eclipse project and created a Dynamic Web Project (**LaundroMatchReservations**)
